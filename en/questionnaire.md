# OSS Questionnaire

## 1. Background

As a continuation of the tradition since the release of the China Open Source Community Survey 2015 in early 2016, at the end of 2023 we launched another annual participatory survey of Chinese open source communities, dedicated to presenting the overall state of open source development in China in a multi-dimensional manner through continued developer survey reports.Using tools such as data analysis and survey reports, we have succeeded in producing a map of China’s open-source world in 2023.

The questionnaire addresses the multiple roles of the interviewees and aims to gain insight into community development trends at various levels.Based on the level of participation of the open source community, the respondents are divided into users, participants, contributors, defenders, and ecooperators.Shape onion model and layer evolution.The following four role levels are defined as：

- User：has used one or more open-source products
- Attendees：Users who interact with the open source community (e.g. communication with open source communities, participation in activities of open source community organizations, etc.)
- Users who contribute substantially to the open source community by contributor：(including code and non-code contributions)
- Maintainer：is primarily responsible for users who operate daily to the open source community (including project maintainer, PCC members, etc.)

In addition, ecological operations are the users who are primarily responsible for day-to-day operations in the open source communities, at a level above the participants and collectively referred to as the operator.In addition to raising basic questions for all interviewees, the questionnaire addresses several different roles for users, contributors and operators.

The **basic information** for this questionnaire is as follows：

- **Survey** ：covers developers, community members, contributors, students, government managers
- **Survey Content** ：mainly covers personal information, work status, open source communities, developer technologies, etc.
- **Survey method** ：Collects samples and data using online questionnaires to analyze data across comparisons
- **Distribution channel** ：Open Source Society, KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China, 2023 Eighth Annual Open Source Conference in China, 2023 Open Atomic Developers Conference, 2023 Open Source Ecological Conference in Open Source Industry 2023
- **Question Type** \* ：single, multiselected, ill
- **Number of questions** ：43
- **Sample Quantity** ：875

## 3. Analysis of the questionnaire

### 3.1 Features of the interviewee

First, we conduct surveys from the point of view of age, gender, academic qualifications, resident city, industry and professional identity, through which basic information about participants can be obtained, thus analysing the identity of the audience groups in open source communities.

#### 3.1.1 Age, gender, education, city

|                                Age                                |                                Gender                                |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-1.png" width="700"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-2.png" width="700"> |


The age distribution of respondents to this questionnaire is similar to that of previous years, mainly in the 21-50 age group, with a more balanced age distribution.It is worth noting that the proportion of respondents under 21 years of age was 25.71 per cent, a significant increase from 8.42 per cent last year.The participation of young respondents in the table has increased considerably.

In terms of gender, the number of respondents was higher, at 73.37 per cent, and the proportion of women was 25.83 per cent.Compared to last year's questionnaire, the proportion of women and men interviewed has increased significantly and is consistent with the current lack of gender balance among developers.

|                                Educational background                                |                                Region                                |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|

The educational level of the respondents is common to the undergraduate and higher; in urban distribution, the majority of the respondents are from Jiangsu, Sichuan and Shanghai, partly because our online sources of questionnaire collection are in those cities.There are also more interviewees in Beijing and Guangdong provinces, and there is a more consistent distribution of developers in the overall distribution and data sets.

#### 3.1.2 Occupation in industry, profession

|                  Industry                  |                      Career status                     |
| :----------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-5.png"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-6.png" width="700">  |

The majority of the respondents were in the Internet/IT / electronic/ communications industry, accounting for 72.23 per cent, indicating that the respondents mainly covered the field of science and technology.

In terms of professional status, 43.20 per cent of students are in school, followed by back-end developers, architects and academic researchers.Overall, the respondents were predominantly technical practitioners and students and covered a number of occupations in computer industries.

### 3.2 Open source participation

#### 3.2.1 Level of participation by open source communities

|       Role of open source communities      |               Time to contact open source              |
| :----------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-7.png"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-8.png" width="700"> |

The survey showed that the vast majority of members of open source communities were users (73.37 per cent), while close to half of the participants (49.03 per cent) and some contributors (26.51 per cent).

In terms of length of access to open sources, one third of respondents had less than one year in contact with open source communities, and nearly half had more than three years of experience.

We have cross-analyzed the question "How much you think you are a member of an open source community" with interviewees' roles in an open source community.

| To what extent they are an open-source community element |
| :------------------------------------------------------: |
|  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-9.png" width="700">  |

It can be seen that there is a greater sense of belonging among the defenders, contributors, ecological operators than those involved and users in the open source community.

The following questions were addressed to respondents who had a role in the open source community at the “user” level and above.

#### 3.2.2 Use of Open Source Products

|        Reason for selecting open source products       |               Factors influencing choice               |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.2-1.png" width="700"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.2-2.png" width="700"> |

The main reason that users chose to use open source software was free of charge for their products, followed by secondary development and a favourable community environment.

In selecting open source products, participants are more focused on the level of code regulation and the activity of developers.This indicates that users are concerned not only about the functionality and quality of open source products, but also about the activity of communities and developers and the sustainability of projects.

|         Problem with using open source products        |    Factors contributing to open source contributions   |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.2-3.png" width="700"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.2-4.png" width="700"> |

Among the problems encountered, the most common is the lack of documentation for the project, followed by an unstable update.

Factors such as personal interest, community climate and technological upgrading play an important role in promoting open-source contributions.

#### 3.2.3 Technical orientation

|             Interested technical directions            |                Known Open Source License               |

The interviewees showed strong interest in artificial intelligence, accounting for 67.43%, followed by the development of tools and packaging and cloud calculations.

For open source licenses, Apache is the most popular option, followed by MIT and GPL.

#### 3.2.4 Information exchange

|             Access to open source products             |            Communication with the community            |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.2-7.png" width="700"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.2-8.png" width="700"> |

When searching for open source products, most people search through a code-hosting platform, recommended through the technical community or the media, and searched by search engines, which is also the choice of many.

Communication with open source communities is mainly in the form of domestic communication tools (e.g. nails, microletters, QQ, books, etc.) and asynchronous communication tools (e.g. GitHub Issue, Discussion, Mail List etc.), while internationalized communication tools (e.g. Slack, Skype, Telegram, Lark and others) are also widely used.The international open source community is characterized by a predominance of asynchronous communication tools, which differ markedly from the national level.

|     Frequently Used Products / Technology Community    |           Media to get open source information          |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: |

Interviewees are mainly engaged through a code hosting platform and open source community participation.In addition, a large number of respondents participated in open source communities through domestic technical forums.

In terms of access to open source information, video platforms and question-and-answer websites are the main options, reflecting the preference of developers for access to open-source knowledge, including through audio-visual and interactive question-and-answer sessions.

### 3.3 Open source contribution

The questions in this section are addressed to interviewees at and above the level of “contributors” in the open-source community.

#### 3.3.1 Level of open source contribution participation

|      Participation in Open Source Project Activity     |        Time of weekly open source participation        |

GitHub remains the preferred platform for the most interviewed, dominating the platform, followed by Gitee and GitLab.The influence of GitHub is still high among domestic developers, but the domestic platform is gradually emerging. The main development languages used include Python, Java, C, JavaScript, Go.In addition, HTML/CSS, TypeScript and others were given a high number of choices.

#### 3.3.3 Open source contribution content

|                 Main contribution type                 |                Contributed project type                |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |

Interviewees contribute to open source projects mainly by writing codes and documents.In addition, open source sermons, open source communities operate and facilitate community activities.

The type of open-source project that contributed was mainly concentrated in library/intermediate and common framework/infrastructure, reflecting the deep attention of developers to the technology base.

#### 3.3.4 Incentives

|                       Incentives                       |               Sources of financial return              |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.3-7.png" width="700"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.3-8.png" width="400"> |

Various incentives have been positively evaluated, indicating that the diversity of incentives has had a positive impact on open source participation by developers.In particular, respondents believe that incentives for honour and social interaction have a more significant positive impact on contributions.

There is no financial return on the participation of more than half of the developers in open source projects.The rest of the developers receive direct financial returns through remuneration/wages, tips and incentives, while very few developers receive financial support through advertising income, donations, and patent/intellectual property benefits.

### 3.4 Community Operations Survey

This section of the question is addressed to interviewees who are “operators” in the open-source community.

#### 3.4.1 Overview of open source communities

|                Number of Community Users               |                    Active developers                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-1.png" width="300"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-2.png" width="250"> |

Nearly 6 operators have less than 200 users in open source communities, almost 3 are more than 500.More than half of the operators have less than 20 active developers in their open source communities.

#### 3.4.2 Open Source Community Management

|                       Community management                      |                Community Business Company Support               |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-3.png" style="width:500px;"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-4.png" style="width:300px;"> |

About half of the communities have clear governance structures and professionals responsible for day-to-day operations.At the same time, communities have generally developed clear norms and provided updated documentation to support their inclusion.

Most open source communities have commercial corporate support and are mainly in the form of declarations and synergistic development.

#### 3.4.3 Commercial research on open source software

|        Use of Open Source Software in Enterprise       |   Do not agree to commercialize open source projects   |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-5.png" width="600"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-6.png" width="350"> |

The vast majority of businesses used open-source software, which contained clear usage requirements and regulatory norms and a sample of no corresponding regulatory norms of 5:6.While the regulatory and regulatory focus of some enterprises in introducing open source software is noted, a large proportion of enterprises are still more loosely regulated, which may be influenced by the size of the enterprise, the differences in industry and the extent to which open-source software is understood.

The level of acceptance for the use of open source projects for commercialization averaged 3.65, of which 31.66 per cent gave the highest acceptance ratings, indicating that most respondents had medium to high acceptance of the project.

### 3.5 Open Source Development Research

#### 3.5.1 Open Source Development

|         Development of open source communities         |

| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.5-1.png" width="500"> |

Overall, the respondents generally viewed the future development of open sources in the country as positive in all its aspects.

| Characteristics of the continuing development of open source projects |  Indicators for the evaluation of open source projects |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
|         <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.5-2.png" width="700"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.5-3.png" width="700"> |

The respondents believe that the most important characteristic that affects the health and sustainability of an open source community is the speed of a rapid community response, and that new and emerging contributors with a continuing influx can be transformed into long-term contributors.Demonstrating long-term sustainability is critical to successful community development.

In evaluating open source projects, respondents focused on project influence, authority, community activity and continued renewal and maintenance.This reflects developers' concerns about the overall state of health of the project at the technical and community levels.

#### 3.5.2 Effects and challenges of artificial intelligence on developers and open source ecology

|                 AI Impact on Developers                |        AI Future Role in Open Source Communities       |
