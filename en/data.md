### Introduction to indicators

**OpenRank**

The OpenRank indicator is a collaborative network indicator developed by the X-lab Open Laboratory and based on an open source developer-project collaborative relationships network, which not only allows for a good overall development of tape projects community participation but also introduces elements of open source ecology, which can be well identified and displayed by such entities as projects, people, organizations, etc. in open source ecology.OpenRank is now widely accepted by industry and academia, including the China Institute for Standardization (ISI) series of Open Source Governance Standards, the ICT White Paper on Open Source Governance, the Open Atomic Open Source Foundation Global Open Source Screen, and the Business Open Source Office Governance Toolkit.

**Activity**

Activity is a statistical indicator of the level of activity of the X-lab researcher or developer. Developer activity is weighted by the behavior of developers, such as Issue, PR, and Code Review. The project's activity is processed by the sum of the total activity of all developers in the project.

## 1. Overall Macro Insight

### 1.1 Basic Events

**Basic events** are the database for this data page analysis and refer to a series of event log data generated by developer activity on GitHub, Gitee, and others on the global open-source collaborative platform. A statistical analysis of underlying events provides a macro insight into the dynamics of global ecological development. This annual open-source report covers the collaborative platforms GitHub, Gitee, and GitLink.

#### 1.1.1 Trends in events across GitHub

First, the total number of events logs for statistical analysis across GitHub is shown in the graph below.

![1-1](/image/data/chapter_1/1-1.png)

<center>Figure 1.1 Trends in GitHub annual events </center>
<br> 

The overall activity of global open sources and the number of active warehouses have increased significantly in recent years, reflecting the growth rate in global open-source development.2023 GitHub log data reached 1.4 billion compared to 2022 when it increased by about 10.32 percent. After high growth in 2018-2020, the GitHub platform's annual event growth gradually declined, with a growth rate of about 10% in 2023. However, the 10 percent growth rate, because of its overall volume, continues to highlight open-source technology's dynamic and critical role in the global digital transition.

#### 1.1.2 Comparison of overall events trends in GitHub and Gitee

Because of the size of the events active on the GitHub platform, the subsequent analysis was built on the benchmark of the top 30,000 active warehouses per platform. For ease of comparison, we have selected GitHub for statistical analysis of 8 categories of events of greater relevance to open source participation in Gitee, including CommunityCommentEvent, ForkEvent, IssueCommentEvent, IssuesEvent, FullRequestEvent, FullRequestReviewCommentEvent, PushEvent, and WatchEvent.

![1-2](/image/data/chapter_1/1-2.png)

<center>Figure 1.2 GitHub and Gitee Active Repository Events </center>
<br> 

The Gitee platform showed a more pronounced growth trend. Even since 2021, the number of incidents in the top 30,000 active warehouses has surpassed GitHub, highlighting the outbreak of active open-source projects in the country. Domestic developers' active participation and contribution to open-source communities have injected new dynamism into technological innovation and knowledge sharing.

However, it must be emphasized that data on the first 30,000 active projects alone does not fully reveal the reality of the global GitHub platform, as the long-end effects are still evident globally. Subsequent analyses will reflect this more clearly, especially in the broad and diverse nature of the GitHub platform as the world's leading open-source community. In the future, with the evolution of technology and the promotion of an open-source culture, the Chinese open-source community can be expected to continue to flourish globally.

Further to the analysis of disaggregated data on underlying events, the results are shown in the figure below.


[1-3](/image/data/chapter_1/1-3.png)

<center>Figure 1.3 GitHub vs. Gitee Active Repository Event Types </center>
<br> 

Can be seen from the analytics results:

The most frequent event type on the GitHub platform is the Push event, while Pull Request events and Issue Comment events rank 2nd and 3rd, respectively. The occurrence rates of each event type have remained relatively stable, reflecting a trend towards a stable ecosystem in GitHub's open-source community.
On the Gitee platform, event data grew significantly in 2020, initially focusing on Watch events. But after 2020, Pull Request and Review Events grew rapidly, becoming the largest event type in 2022 and growing steadily in 2023. The structural changes in Gitee event data reflect a significant shift in the role of domestic developers from a watchdog to a contributor, which is consistent with observations worldwide.

#### 1.1.3 GitLink Events Analysis

For the GitLink platform, we have also selected the top 30,000 active repositories as benchmarks. Given the limitations of the data, only data covering the six types of events—CommunityCommentEvent, ForkEvent, IssueCommentEvent, IssuesEvent, FullRequestEvent, and WatchEvent—were selected for analysis.

![1-17](/image/data/chapter_1/1-17.png)

<center>Data analysis of events on the GitLink platform </center>
<br> 

While the number of active repository events on GitLink still lags behind platforms like GitHub and Gitee, it exhibits a notable upward trend. On the GitLink platform, Issues events and CommitComment events constitute the vast majority of active repository events.

### 1.2 Active Repository

#### 1.2.1 Trends in GitHub total number of active warehouses

The following figure shows the statistical analysis of the overall activity trends of GitHub and Gitee active repositories.

![1-4](/image/data/chapter_1/1-4.png)

<center>Figure 1.5 Trends in the number of GitHub annual active repositories </center>
<br>


According to overall data for 2023, the total number of active repositories worldwide reached 87.92 million, marking a 4.06% increase from the previous year; this aligns with the overall trend in events, which has been declining annually since experiencing high growth from 2018 to 2020. This decline could stem from the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic developments.

Because of the gap in the number of GitHub and Gitee warehouses, the following analytical work is also based on 30,000 active repositories in front of each platform.

#### 1.2.2 Comparison of the overall activity of GitHub and Gitee

The graph below shows the statistical analysis of GitHub and Gitee's overall activity in the repositories.

![1-5](/image/data/chapter_1/1-5.png)

<center>Figure 1.6 GitHub vs. Gitee active repository activity </center>
<br>

Looking at the activity data of the top 30,000 active repositories from each platform, the overall activity on the Gitee platform grew rapidly from 2019 onwards. By 2022, it surpassed GitHub and maintained this high-growth trend, revealing the enormous vitality of open-source development in China during this period.

![1-6](/image/data/chapter_1/1-6.png)

<center>Figure 1.7 GitHub compared to Gitee active repository activity </center>
<br>

Furthermore, the detailed analysis of the composition of the activity reveals the following:


On the GitHub platform, the activity stemming from "Create PR" events comprises nearly half of the total activity, while "Merge PR" events contribute to approximately one-fourth. Reviewing PRs contributes around 10% of the activity, while the combined activity from issue creation and comments nearly matches, accounting for 7%.

On the Gitee platform, the highest activity contribution comes from reviewing PRs, constituting two-thirds of the total activity. Similarly to GitHub, "Merge PR" events follow closely behind in activity contribution, with a proportion comparable to that on the GitHub platform. A surprising finding is that while "Create PR" events contribute the highest proportion of activity on GitHub, they contribute the least on the Gitee platform, accounting for only 2% of the total activity events.

#### 1.2.3 GitHub and Gitee overall active repository OpenRank trends vs.

The graph below shows the statistical analysis of GitHub and Gitee's active repository, OpenRank trends.

![1-7](/image/data/chapter_1/1-7.png)

<center>Figure 1.8 GitHub vs. Gitee Active Repository OpenRank </center>
<br>

Although the activity of the top 30,000 repositories on Gitee briefly surpassed that of GitHub in 2022, the influence gap measured by OpenRank remains significant (approximately 5:2). Not only is the gap considerable but there also seems to be no indication of it narrowing in terms of trends. This is particularly noteworthy and underscores a key area of focus for future open-source development in China.


### 1.3 Active users

#### 1.3.1 Trends in the total number of active users on GitHub

The following figure presents a statistical analysis of the overall active user count on GitHub.

![1-8](/image/data/chapter_1/1-8.png)

<center>Figure 1.9 Trends in GitHub annual active users </center>
<br>

In 2023, the total number of active developers in the field reached 21.93 million, an increase of 8.88 percent over the previous year. Like the GitHub active warehouse, after nearly five years of high growth, the growth rate began to decline in 2020. The growth of active users on the GitHub platform began to slow (although the GitHub official announced at the beginning of 2023 that the overall number of users of its platform surpassed 100 million), there was also some correlation with changes in the global situation and the rise of a platform like Gitee.

#### 1.3.2 Active user geographical distribution and ranking

The annual report can include detailed geo-location data analysis for GitHub developers as a contribution to the award-winning game of the OpenDigger Open Source Software Ecological Data Analysis Dredging Platform ([OpenSODA](https://github.com/ECNU/OpenSODA)).

The following analysis is based on approximately 2 million developers who have correctly filled in their geographical location information out of the 10 million active developers on GitHub in 2023. Considering the total registered users on GitHub to be 100 million, the sampling ratio is approximately 2%.

**1. Geographical distribution of global developers**

First, analyze developers' geographical distribution worldwide, as shown in the following chart.

|    14   |      Spain     |     28928    |    1.49%   |      19509      |    67.44%   |
|    15   |   South Korea  |     28325    |    1.46%   |      21811      |    77.00%   |

Overall, developers from various countries are continuously increasing:

- The United States ranks first due to its early involvement in the open-source domain and its advantage in technology talent.
- Based on the calculated total number of developers from the United States in the table (409,000), the actual number of developers from the United States on GitHub is estimated to be around 21.01 million, with a deviation of approximately 4% from the official data released by GitHub (22 million).
- India, China, and Brazil, with their large population bases, rank second, third, and fourth in terms of the number of developers. However, based on the activity rate (annual active users/total users), China has the highest rate among the top four.
- Developers from European countries also constitute a significant force in the open-source community, collectively ranking second in volume.
- According to the official data released by GitHub and Gitee (both around 12 million), the total number of global open-source developers from China is likely to exceed 20 million, roughly equivalent to the number from the United States in quantity alone.

**2. Geographical distribution of Chinese developers**

Further analysis shows the geographical distribution of Chinese developers, as shown in the graph below\.Of these, the data sources are almost 150,000 developers of “China” users who correctly fill out provincial information.

![1-10](/image/data/chapter_1/1-10.png)

<center> Figure 1.11 Geographical distribution of Chinese developers </center>
<br>

According to data from GitHub 2023 Q3 quarter, the total number of Chinese developers is approximately 18.8 million, which can be estimated on the basis of proportion to the total actual developers in each province.

- The number of open source developers in the North, Upper and Zhej's four major cities has surpassed one million classes, particularly in Beijing;
- The fifth and eighth places respectively of Taiwan and Hong Kong, highlighting the importance of Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait;
- The open source developer in the Long Triangle (Jijjiang Zhejushu) region has reached almost 38.8 million;
- The central western regions, such as Sichuan, Hubei and Shaanxi, have also shown good performance, particularly in Sichuan, which has attracted a large number of developers through their suitable, fast-growing software industries.

### 1.4 Open source licenses

#### 1.4.1 Number of warehouses using open-source licenses

The graph below shows the number of open-source licenses that GitHub's active repository uses.

<center>
<img src="/image/data/chapter_1/1-11.png" alt="1-11" width="450px"/> 
</center>

<center> Figure 1.12 Number of warehouses using open source licenses </center>
<br>

The analysis revealed that the most used open-source licenses are currently available, including MIT licenses, Apache licenses v2.0, GNU General Public Licence v3.0, and BSD 3-Clause licenses. Of these, MIT licenses rank first to reach 60%. The MIT license is named after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The simplicity and flexibility of MIT licenses have made it one of the licenses chosen by many developers and have provided the least legal restrictions to encourage developers to use and disseminate software freely.

#### 1.4.2 Trends in Open-Source Licensing Types

Statistical analysis has been conducted on the trends of open-source license types, as shown in the following figures.

![1-12](/image/data/chapter_1/1-12.png)

<center> Figure 1.13  Trends in the Number of Open Source License Types </center>
<br>

Overall, the number of open-source license types has continuously increased since 2017. Introducing licenses such as the Eclipse Public License 2.0, the European Union Public License 1.2, and others contributed to the growth observed between 2017 and 2018. Subsequently, the growth rate of open-source license types slowed down. Between 2021 and 2022, a new batch of open-source licenses, such as the Mulan Series Licenses and the CERN License v2, began to emerge. Following this, the development trend stabilized, and currently, the mainstream license types on GitHub have remained steady at 46 types for two years.

### 1.4.3 Trends in the Number of Repositories Using Open Source Licenses

According to Github's log data, in 2023, nearly 7.7 million active repositories used various open-source licenses, accounting for 8.76% of all active repositories. We present the MIT License's data separately due to its significant influence.

**1. Trends in the Number of Repositories Using the MIT License**

Statistical analysis of the trends in the number of repositories using the MIT License is shown in the following figure.

![1-13](/image/data/chapter_1/1-13.png)

<center> Figure 1.14: Trends in the Number of Repositories Using the MIT License </center>
<br>

Observations:

- The MIT License is currently the most popular open-source license, with 1.58 million active repositories in 2023.
- The trends in the number of repositories using the MIT License are similar to those of the total repository count, with significant growth observed. However, the growth rate slowed down in 2022 and 2023, which correlates with the overall slowdown in project growth.

**2. Trends in the Number of Repositories Using Other Top Five Open Source Licenses**

The following figure shows a statistical analysis of the trends in the number of repositories using other top-five open-source licenses.

![1-14](/image/data/chapter_1/1-14.png)

<center> Figure 1.15: Trends in the Number of Repositories Using Other Licenses </center>
<br>

Observations:

- The number of open-source licenses is growing, with MIT, Apache, and GNU licenses remaining the top choices.
- Differences between niche and popular open-source licenses still exist.
- Since 2022, the usage of GNU General Public License (GPL) versions 2 and 3 has been declining overall, while GNU Affero General Public License version 3 has been increasing yearly.

#### 1.4.3 Trends in the Number of Repositories Using the Mulan Series Licenses

The following figure shows a statistical analysis of the trends in the number of repositories using the Mulan Series Licenses.

![1-15](/image/data/chapter_1/1-15.png)

<center> Figure 1.16 Accumulative Trends in the Number of Repositories Using the Mulan Series Licenses </center>
<br>

The Mulan Series Licenses (including the Mulan Permissive Software License and the Mulan Public License, among others) are drafted, revised, and released by Peking University, with the support of the National Standardization Technical Committee on Cloud Computing and the China Open Source Cloud Alliance. As the first open-source software agreement recognized by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) in China, the Mulan Permissive Software License (Mulan PSL) holds significant influence. 

Observations indicate a growth in repositories utilizing the Mulan licenses starting September 2022. By December 2023, there were 220 such active repositories, showcasing the increasing influence of Mulan open-source licenses.

### 1.5 Programming Languages

From the table above:

- The top five programming languages most used by developers are JavaScript, Python, HTML, TypeScript, and Java, which represent the leading programming languages developers use. Starting from the sixth-ranked CSS, the number of users decreased by nearly half compared to Java, the fifth-ranked language.

#### 1.5.2 Trends in Programming Language Usage from 2019 to 2023

Statistical analysis of developers' programming language usage trends from 2019 to 2023 is depicted in the following figure.

![1-16](/image/data/chapter_1/1-16.png)

<center>Figure 1.17: Trends in Programming Language Usage from 2019 to 2023</center>
<br>

Observations from the figure:

- JavaScript, Python, HTML, TypeScript, and Java are the leading programming languages developers use.
- Python and TypeScript have shown rapid growth compared to the other three primary languages and have maintained a consistently rapid growth trend over the past five years.
- TypeScript, in particular, has experienced rapid growth in the number of users over the past five years. In 2021, it significantly surpassed other programming languages, becoming one of the main programming languages developers use. Perhaps by 2024, the number of developers using it will be comparable to the number of developers using HTML, which is ranked third.



## 二. OpenRank Rankings

**Rankings** are a popular form of presenting analysis results. 

The 2023 China Open Source Annual Report separates the rankings into a dedicated section for centralized display. This is partly to showcase better the development trends of various entities (repositories/projects, countries/regions, enterprises, foundations, developers, etc.) in the open source ecosystem, and another important reason is the maturation of the OpenRank indicators and the completeness of global data.

With the addition of global data from both GitHub and Gitee this year, we are able to take a global perspective with China's open source as the starting point, allowing the world to see the joint efforts and contributions of Chinese enterprises, foundations, developers, and other entities in developing the global open-source ecosystem, which is not available in other reports on the market.

## 3. Enterprise Insights

Enterprises are the core force driving the development of the global open-source ecosystem. They are initiators, as well as developers and maintainers, at the forefront of the development and commercial exploration of open-source projects.


### 3.1 Evolution of Global Enterprise OpenRank Over the Past 10 Years

![3-1](/image/data/chapter_3/3-1.png)


![3-1](/image/data/chapter_3/3-1.png)

<center> Figure 3.1 Changes in China Enterprise OpenRank Rankings </center>
<br>

Observations on the global impact of enterprise open source are as follows:

- Microsoft began laying out open source over a decade ago (in 2008) and reached the pinnacle of global open source influence in 2016, a position it has held unchallenged to this day.
- Since being officially sanctioned by the United States in 2019, Huawei has made open source a strategic priority. It has been soaring ever since and surpassed Google and Amazon this year.
- Alibaba has been a leader in domestic open source until 2021 and has maintained its sixth position globally.
- Ant Group's performance in the past three years has been remarkable, and it officially entered the top ten in the world in 2023.
- Baidu, the fourth largest player in domestic open source, has fallen to 12th globally due to rapid changes in the domestic open source landscape.
- According to the [OpenLeaderboard](https://open-leaderboard.x-lab.info/), Chinese enterprises entering the top 30 globally also include ByteDance (18), PingCAP (19), Feizhiyun (24), Deepin (25), Tencent (26), and Espressif (27).

### 3.2 Evolution of China Enterprise OpenRank Over the Past 10 Years

![3-2](/image/data/chapter_3/3-2.png)

<center> Figure 3.2 Changes in China Enterprise OpenRank Rankings </center>
<br>

This chart effectively demonstrates the open-source strategies of domestic companies and their changing trends:

Huawei began to make efforts in 2019 and, in just two years, achieved first place in China and second place globally.
As traditional domestic leaders in open source, Alibaba and Ant have shown stable performance.
- Baidu has slipped to fourth place due to competition from the first three.
- ByteDance has made visible and rapid progress in recent years.
- Espressif (Espressif Systems) is a relatively low-profile semiconductor open-source leader in China.
- Fit2Cloud is another low-key but pragmatic open-source enterprise, with several open-source software under its belt being highly favored by developers.
- Tencent, PingCAP, JD, and TAOS have shown a slight downward trend in the past two years, indicating that competition in the post-pandemic era will intensify.

</div>

<center> Figure 3.3 Proportion of China Enterprises' OpenRank among Global Enterprises (Left) and Comparison of OpenRank between Chinese and American Enterprises at the Project Level (Right) </center>
<br>

The left chart shows the trend of increasing influence of Chinese enterprises in the global open source ecosystem, while the right chart reflects the trend of ups and downs between China and the United States in the post-trade war era, especially after the pandemic. The influence of Chinese open source has risen significantly, as has the influence of companies like Huawei. However, it can also be seen that the gap between Chinese and American enterprises in overall open source influence is still significant (about 3 times the difference). Still, this momentum is very promising for the future.

## 4. Foundations Insights

This section examines the development of open-source ecology from a foundation perspective. Foundations are non-profit organizations that play a crucial role in organizing, developing, and innovating open-source projects and communities. They provide comprehensive support in technology, operations, and law to incubate open-source software and guide the building and operation of open-source communities. Foundations act as incubators and accelerators and are essential organizers of the open-source ecosystem. This year, we have included a separate section on insights from open-source foundations, where we can see the global impact of China's open-source foundations.

### 4.1 Global Foundation OpenRank trend analysis

<div align=center>
<img src="/image/data/chapter_4/4-1.png" width="700px">


</div>
<center> Figure 4.1 Global Foundation OpenRank Overall Trend </center>
<br>

The following trends can be seen in：

- The Apache Foundation's #1 ranking has evolved at a mature and steady pace, and today it remains the first choice for many companies to develop globalization projects;
- OpenAtom Open Source Foundation was founded more than three years ago, the rapid development of its projects, and the total impact of its projects beyond the Linux Foundation's sub-foundations, ranked second only after the Apache Foundation;
- LF AI & Data ranked third, outpacing CNCF in cloud-native due to advancements in AI.;

<br>

This year marks the first time we can observe the development of projects under the Open Atom Flag:

- The top three are OpenHarmony, openEuler, and Anolis, representing the absolute status of the operating system, especially OpenHarmony, which is developing the fastest;
- Other listed projects are developing steadily, and we look forward to their progress in the new year.

## 5. Technological insights

The technology field is rapidly evolving, especially in various subfields. **Operating systems** are being developed in new architectures, **cloud native** are driving digital transformation, **databases** are becoming the infrastructure for data innovation, **big data** is facilitating intelligent decision-making, **artificial intelligence** is accelerating automation in various industries, and **front-end** technologies are focusing on interaction and aesthetics. These areas are at the forefront of technology, attracting innovators and investors and creating a booming trend. In this section, we will provide insights into these six areas in terms of two metrics: influence and activity.

### 5.1 Overall development trend of six major technology areas in the past five years

![5-1](/image/data/chapter_5/5-1.png)

## 6. Insights on open source projects

In 2023, large AI models like GPT-4 and CLIP emerged, leading to competition among global enterprises to invest in research and development for cutting-edge technologies like language understanding and image generation. The industry saw rapid evolution, marking the beginning of a new era in the broad application of AI. The database field experienced a trend of innovation with various technologies like distributed databases, time-series databases, and graph databases emerging to cater to different application scenarios. Cloud-native databases became popular, offering flexible scaling and high availability. This section provides data insights on project types by statistically analyzing project topics. In-depth insights are also provided into the two core areas of database and AI.

### 6.1 Type of project

This subsection selects the top 10,000 active GitHub repositories for statistical analysis.

#### 6.1.1 Ratios for different project types

<img width="600" alt="6-1" src="/image/data/chapter_6/6-1.png">

<center> Figure 6.1 Ratios for different project types </center>
<br>

- Software development primarily comprises components and frameworks (libraries and frameworks), which constitute 31.36% of it. Developers enjoy using these open-source collaborative innovations, which are the most popular types to contribute to;
- The Application Software category is second only to the Component Framework category (24.34%) due to its utility, enabling all users (not just developers) to utilize open source software in a variety of industries and domains;
- Non-Software content holds a significant share of 23.17%. It shows the growing trend of open-source as a collaborative development model that extends to the entire content domain, including documentation, education, art, hardware, and other non-programming-related areas;
- Developers find the Software Tools category valuable as it allows them to focus on building software applications and products, making up 18.9% of their work;
- The System Software category comprises fundamental software, accounting for only 2.3% of the total despite its immense value and complexity.

#### 6.1.2 Percentage of OpenRank by Project Type

<img width="600" alt="6-2" src="/image/data/chapter_6/6-2.png">

<br>
<center> Figure 6.2 Percentage of OpenRank by Project Type </center>
<br>

Let's take this a step further and look at these categories through the lens of OpenRank influence:

- The most significant change is that content resource type (Non-Software) projects have relatively low impact, although they have high activity;
- System Software, on the other hand, has a small percentage of activity but a relatively large percentage of influence, and a similar phenomenon can be observed with Software Tools projects;
- The component framework type and the application software type have not changed much, and both are among the more prevalent types.

#### 6.1.3 OpenRank Trends by Project Type in the Last 5 Years

<br>
<center> Figure 6.3 OpenRank Trends by Project Type in the Last 5 Years </center>
<br>

As you can see from the five-year OpenRank evolution chart above, the influence of the System Software category is increasing year by year, while the influence of the Non Software category is decreasing.

### 6.2 Project Topic Analysis

This section also analyzes the top 10,000 active GitHub repositories and obtains insights from the Topic tags under the repositories.

- Hacktoberfest is an annual event that takes place in October. It aims to promote the open-source community and is organized by DigitalOcean in collaboration with GitHub. The goal of the event is to encourage more people to participate in open-source projects and contribute to the community. OpenRank is used to measure people's enthusiasm for open-source projects, community involvement, and contributions. Developers play an active role in the campaign by submitting Pull Requests to open-source projects, thus helping to increase the reputation and influence of the repository.
- JavaScript and Python：technologies have maintained relatively stable trends over the past few years, with no significant growth or decline.

### 6.3 Project analysis in the field of databases

This section uses information from open-source databases, which are disclosed in the [Database of Databases](https://dbdb.io/) and [DB-Engines Ranking](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking). The field is divided into 18 subcategories based on the storage structure and usage of databases. These subcategories include Relational, Key-value, Document, Search Engine, Wide Column, Time Series, Graph, Vector, Object Oriented, Hierarchical, RDF, Array, Event, Spatial, Native XML, Multivalue, Content, and Network. We then collect and analyze corresponding database information on GitHub. We examine the corresponding open-source projects for each database and gather and analyze their collaboration log data on GitHub. This helps us gain detailed insights into the field.

The OpenRank and activity rankings for 2023 for each sub-domain of the database domain show that:

- Relational, key-value, and document databases are the top three subdomains, accounting for over 70% of the database domain;
- Relational's two indicators exceeded those of the second through fifth-place finishers combined and accounted for more than 40 percent of the database field, making it a mega-subcategory.

#### 6.3.2 Trends over the last five years in projects under the various subfields of the database area

![6-6](/image/data/chapter_6/6-6.png)

Figure 6.6 Trends in OpenRank by Subdomain in Database Domain (2019 - 2023)

![6-7](/image/data/chapter_6/6-7.png)

Figure 6.7 Trends in Activity by Subdomain in Database Domain (2019 - 2023)

The trend of OpenRank and the trend of activity of projects in each subdomain of the database domain over the past five years shows that:

- Over the past five years, Relational, Key-value, and Document have consistently ranked in the top three in both indicators;
- Search Engine, Wide Column, Time Series, Graph, Vector, and Object Oriented ranked fourth through ninth, with both indicators trending upward;
- Search Engine and Vector subcategories have shown a fast growth rate. Search Engines have jumped two positions to become the fourth largest subcategory. Vector is still competing with the Graph subcategory and has the potential to improve its OpenRank. The influence created by the large model has not yet subsided, and it is predicted that Vector will overtake Graph by 2024.

#### 6.3.3 Open source quadrant map of projects under each sub-domain of the database domain

There are three metrics involved in the Open Source Quadrant diagram: Activity, Openrank, and CommunityVolume. CommunityVolume is the same formula as the Attention metric in open-digger, i.e. a weighted sum of the number of stars and the number of forks of the target project in a given period of time:`sum(1*star+2*fork)`.

Quadrant plotting methods：

1. Select the Top 10 projects by activity for each database subcategory;
2. Make a `log(x)-log(y)` scatterplot of `log(openrank)-log(communityvolume)`, the base of the log is 2, denote the number of half-lives required for the spatial influence openrank and the temporal influence communityvolume to decay to 1, respectively.
3. The vertical line corresponding to the mean value of the horizontal coordinates of all points on the graph is used as the vertical axis, and the horizontal line corresponding to the mean value of the vertical coordinates of all points on the graph is used as the horizontal axis to divide into four quadrants.

There are a total of 18 subcategory labels in the database domain, and the top 9 categories that account for more than 1% of activity in 2023 were selected for statistical analysis to map the open source quadrant as follows:

<br />

The search engine category is highly polarized, with projects like ElasticSearch with high OpenRank and CommmunityVolume, and projects like Sphinx and Xapian with very low OpenRank and CommmunityVolume.

From the first quadrant: relational, document, search engine, and vector are all database types with strong openrank influence and CommmunityVolume focus, while object_oriented is relatively weak in both areas.

The Open Source Quadrant plot shows the vertical distribution of the Top 9 subclasses of databases in terms of activity. Among these subclasses, two stand out - search engine and vector. These two subclasses have a higher community volume than OpenRank, which means they have more active contributors. They also have a higher community voice, meaning their opinions and feedback are more valued. Additionally, they are known for faster development expectations compared to the other subclasses.

|    10   |  Shaanxi  |   1993   |

Beijing is found to have the most GitHub users in China, followed by Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Zhejiang. Most of China's active GitHub users are in the eastern coastal regions, while some central provinces such as Shaanxi, Hunan, and Hubei also have a lot of active users, and it's worth noting that Sichuan has the most active GitHub users outside of the coastal regions.

**4. GitHub China Developer Influence Distribution after OpenRank Weighting**

Trying to do the aggregation with the OpenRank value of the developers in each region, we get the influence distribution map and regional ranking of Chinese developers, as shown in the following graph.

![7-3.png](/image/data/chapter_7/7-3.png)

<center> Figure 7.4 OpenRank influence distribution of Chinese developers </center>
<br>

Table 7.3 OpenRank Influence Ranking in China
<br>

| Ranking |  Regions  |  OpenRank |
| :-----: | :-------: | :-------: |
|    1    |  Beijing  | 506624.08 |
|    2    |   Sengah  | 435804.42 |
|    3    | Guangdong | 306014.24 |
|    4    |  Zhejiang | 274284.92 |
|    5    |   Taiwan  | 216991.49 |
|    6    |  Chechen  |  96881.79 |
|    7    |  Jiangsu  |  83321.13 |
|    8    | Hong Kong |  83238.46 |
|    9    |   Hubei   |  51370.74 |
|    10   |   Fujian  |  33482.25 |

As you can see from the rankings, the OpenRank regional rankings are highly consistent with the regional rankings for the number of active developers:

- There are significant regional differences in terms of the influence of Chinese developers. Developers from Beijing and Shanghai dominate the first class, while developers from Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Taiwan fall into the second class. These regions have a different level of influence compared to those ranked lower;
- The overall number of active people in Sichuan is smaller than in Jiangsu, but the overall influence is greater, and the same phenomenon occurs in Fujian and Shaanxi.

### 7.2 Developer Working Hours Analysis

This section analyzes the working hours of GitHub and Gitee developers. By default, the time is in the UTC zone, with an 8-hour lag compared to the East Eighth Time Zone, i.e., Beijing Standard Time. The data is scaled to the [1-10] range by default using the min-max method, with larger dots representing higher values in the time zone graph.

#### 7.2.1 Distribution of working hours of global developers 

**Distribution of working hours of GitHub-wide developers**

According to statistics on developers' working hours across GitHub, the majority of developers work between 6 and 21 hours. There is a higher concentration of developers working at 12 o'clock, likely due to timed tasks. Weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are relatively inactive.

![7-5.png](/image/data/chapter_7/7-5.png)

![7-6.png](/image/data/chapter_7/7-6.png)

<center>Figure 7.6 Gitee-wide developer working hours in 2023</center>
<br>

The Gitee data clearly aligns more with the East Eighth Time Zone's work time routine.

**Global developer working hours distribution, excluding bots**

![7-7.png](/image/data/chapter_7/7-7.png)

<center>Figure 7.7 2023 Global Developers' Working Hours, Excluding Robots</center>
<br>

RAfter removing the bot data, it is found that the time distribution of developers is more prevalent in the interval of 6:00 - 21:00, which is more evenly distributed.

#### 7.2.2 Distribution of working hours on the project

Below is a comparison of the working hours distribution of the top four Chinese OpenRank repositories and the top four global OpenRank GitHub repositories in 2023.

### 7.3 Developer Role Analysis

This section categorizes GitHub users into four roles: **Explorer**, **Participant**, **Contributor**, and **Committer**, based on events they trigger in open-source repositories. The four roles are defined in the table below.

<center> Table 7.5 Four Roles of Developer
</center>
<br>

| Roles                                        | Definitions                                                       | Meaning                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Explorer                                     | Users who star a project                                         | Indicates the user has some interest in the project          |
| Participants                                 | Users who have made an Issue or Comment on a project | Indicates user participation in the project         |
| Contributor | Users with Pull Requests (PRs) for a project      | Indicates that the user has contributed to the project's code base |
| Commiter | Users participating in PR-review or merge                          | Indicates that the user has contributed deeply to the project   |

The figure below shows the four cascaded and structured roles. Using the defined role structure, we evaluate the top 10 projects in the OpenRank rankings of GitHub-wide projects from three perspectives: number of roles, time change, and developer role evolution. This is based on the project ranking list in Part II.

<br>

![7-17.png](/image/data/chapter_7/7-17.png)

<center> Figure 7.17 Developer Role Distribution Map </center>
<br>

Spring：

- Based on the number of explorers, the three most popular projects are godotengine/godot, microsoft/vscode, and home-assistant/core, suggesting they have received widespread attention and support;
- microsoft/vscode is the project with the largest gap between the number of participants and contributors, while microsoft/winget-pkgs has the smallest gap between the two;
- NixOS/nixpkgs has the highest number of committers at 2,638 compared to other projects. In contrast, the digitalinnovationone/dio-lab-open-source project has the lowest number of committers.

#### 7.3.2 New additions to roles in 2023

Role additions are counted as valid additions to role X if a user who was not in role X (e.g., a contributor or submitter role) before 2023 becomes in that role in 2023.

For example, if A submits a PR to Project B in 2021 (but never participates in the Code Review process), and A reviews the PR in Project B in 2023, A is the new committer.

The details of the roles added are shown in the graph below and the table below.

The results showed:

- The repository godotengine/godot received the highest number of stars, 22,996, with half added in September 2023 due to game developers seeking open-source alternatives to Unity's new charging strategy. Meanwhile, digitalinnovationone/dio-lab-open-source and Microsoft/winget-pkgs received the fewest new stars, 504 and 1,373, respectively;
- The repository with the highest number of new participants was microsoft/vscode with 10,216; digitalinnovationone/dio-lab-open-source had the fewest new Issues with 732;
- The repository with the highest number of new contributors was NixOS/nixpkgs with 1,622;
- The repository with the highest number of new committers was also NixOS/nixpkgs with 1,226.

#### 7.3.3 Perspectives on Developer Evolution

The developer evolution process is defined as the number of roles in an open-source community that moves to other roles. This report only measures the number of developers who have moved from one role to a more profound one. For example, a user who participated until 2023 will change from a participant to a contributor in 2023 when they make their first PR.

The results showed:

- Across communities, we can observe the typical funnel model of an evolutionary path from explorers to participants to contributors and committers. In godotengine/godot, for example, 330 contributors successfully evolved to committers, 131 participants became contributors, while 63 explorers evolved to participants. This trend was also observed in other communities and is consistent with the general evolution of community members from initial exploration to deeper involvement.
- In some communities, such as NixOS/nixpkgs, we observed many contributors evolving into committers. In this community, 254 contributors successfully evolved into committers, which may represent a relatively high demand for code review. This may encourage more contributors to become deeply involved in maintenance, which may help improve the quality and stability of the community's code.
- In some communities, such as flutter/flutter and godotengine/godot, we observed a relatively high number of successful conversions of explorers into participants. In flutter/flutter, 419 explorers evolved into participants, while in godotengine/godot, 330 explorers turned into participants.
- The digitalinnovationone/dio-lab-open-source project has no data since it was created in 2023.

### 7.4 Robot account analysis

Robotic (bot) automation is a significant contributor to open-source collaboration platforms. This section analyzes nearly 600 million repository events across 7.7 million open-source repositories and over 1,200 bot accounts for 2023.

#### 7.4.1 Analysis of robotic activity data

<div align="center">
    <img src="/image/data/chapter_7/7-21.png" alt="7-21" width="400px"/>   
    <img src="/image/data/chapter_7/7-20.png" alt="7-20" width="300px"/>
</div>

<center>Figure 7.20 Trends in robot personnel number (left) in 2023 (right)</center>
<br>

Analysis of robot activity data from 2015 to 2023, partially observed as：

The number of robotic personnel has increased from 4,217,635 to 304,257,084, with a marked increase.From 2019 onwards, the number of robotic personnel has risen sharply, particularly in the GitHub platform from 2019 to 2021 with an explosive increase in the number of robotic activity on GitHub due to the spread and refinement of GitHub automation, continuous integration/continued deployment (CI/CD) tools.

Although the number of robot accounts is low, each robot serves multiple warehouses, showing high efficiency and widespread impact

#### 7.4.2 Machine personnel type analysis

![7-22.png](/image/data/chapter_7/7-22.png)

<center> Figure 7.21 Differences between the number of GitHub events and the annual growth rate (%) (2022 vs 2023)</center>
<br>

This chart shows the volume changes and growth rates of events in 2022 and 2023 with GitHub events.By comparing data for these two years, we can see trends in robot account usage in development processes：

- The inverse of code push is：PushEvent dominates the robot account activity, especially when the number rose significantly in 2023, indicating that robot accounts play an important role in maintaining and updating the code;
- Changes in：CreateEvent were very active in 2022 but decreased in 2023, which may indicate a decline in robotic account activity in the creation of new projects;
- The importance of code review and collaboration is high in both：FullRequestEvent and IssueComment Events and shows the active participation of robot numbers in code reviews and issues discussions;
- Changes in activity type：DeleteEvent decreased in 2022 compared to 2023 and ReleaseEvent increased, reflecting the different focus of robot account in project life cycle management;
- The increase in the number of events associated with the comment：CommunityEvent and FullRequestReviewComment event increased in 2023, indicating that the robot account is increasingly being discussed and feedback in the code review process;
- Specific Uses of Robotic Accounts：Less common event types such as GollumEvent, MemberEvent, PublicEvent, and WatchEvent are relatively low in number, suggesting that robotic accounts are primarily used for specific automation tasks and are less involved in social interactions.

#### 7.4.3 Distribution of working hours for robot accounts

A similar distribution of hours worked by developers allows analysis of robotic work time data.

![7-23.png](/image/data/chapter_7/7-23.png)

<center> Figure 7.22 Distribution of robot account hours </center>
<br>

- Robot account hours distributed mainly between 0 and 1 and 12 to 13 points;
- Based on developer time zones, it can be assumed that most automated processes are active in the early morning and middle hours;
- Robots work hours are less relevant to workdays and non-workdays, most automated collaborative missions are scheduled and fewer are related to responding to event events for contributors.

## 8. Case analysis

### 8.1 Open Euler Community Case Analysis

In 2023, Gitee data was integrated into the OpenDigger community for the first time. Gite's projects were also involved in OpenRank calculations.During this year, the openEuler community became the second largest open source community in China with 16,728 OpenRank values beyond PaddlePaddle.

In 2023, the openEuler community attracted 3,941 developers to collaborative discussions on issues or PR with 1,934 contributors successfully contributing to the openEuler community’s warehouse and combined into at least one PR.

It is worth mentioning that the openEuler community launched a document capturing campaign in early 2023 and embedded the interactive page contribution mechanism with Gitee in the network of community documentation officers.This mechanism allows developers to modify Gitee Lightweight PRs directly on the official web when they read documents without going to the Gitee platform or performing Git operations.

The data changes brought about by this innovative mechanism are impressive, and the openeuler/docs warehouse combined 7,764 PRs in 2023, where 74% of the PR was submitted directly via official web pages.The mechanism has also significantly increased the number of active contributors per month (from 30 to 80) and the monthly average number of PR participants (from 116 to 72).

Another project of concern is openeuler/mugen, which is extremely active as a test framework project for the openEuler community.In 2023, 138 developers participated in project discussions and contributions, and 95 developers joined PR.OpenRank ranks third in the entire openEuler community for this project, the first largest of which is an openeuler/docs repository and an openeuler/kernel repository.This excellent test framework provides developers with the facility to quickly prepare and run test examples, which can help them verify the validity and validity of contribution codes and greatly reduce the process cost of subsequent contributions.

It is no accident that the openEuler community obtained a high OpenRank value as described above.Not only have they designed interactive contribution mechanisms for high-frequency low-threshold documentation that cost almost zero, but they also provide an excellent testing framework that helps contributors to quickly validate the accuracy of their contribution code.These excellent developers experience optimization is an example that open source communities deserve to learn and replicate.

### 8.2 A list of top level warehouses contributed by Chinese developers
